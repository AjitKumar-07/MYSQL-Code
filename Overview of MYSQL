Database - It is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed, 
In order to manage our databases we use a software application called Database Management System.
Databases are classified into 2 types :- 1. Relational ,in which we store data in tables linked eachother using relationship.
                                         2. Non Relational i.e NoSQL

Some important learning concept in MYSQL:-
Retriving data, Inserting data, deleting data, updating data, views, stored procedure & functions, Triggers, Events, Transaction, Designing and securing databse.
we will write sql quiries in MYSQL Workbench , This is the Graphical tool that we use to connect our database server and manage our database.
*SQL is not a Case sensitive language.

2 main shortcut keys we often used while executing queries are:-
Ctrl+Enter = Execute current statement
Ctrl+Shift+Enter= Execute all or selected portion

Important syntax :-

To create database = Create Database database_name;
for eg:- Create Database div;

if we want to work under any database that we have created earlier i.e div , then the syntax will be :- USE div; 
To comment out any line we use -- i.e two minus sign in the starting of any lines.

Basic Structure of Select Statement:- 
Select * from dept where dept_id =1 orderby first_name desc; -- Here desc is used for descending order.

Syntax for creating table :-
Create table Table_name(column1 datatype,column2 datatype,column3 datatype,.....);
eg:- create table dept (first_name varchar(20),dept_id int,sex char(1)); 

Syntax for inserting a row in a table:-
Insert into table_name(column1,column2,column3,....)values(value1,value2,value3,....);
eg:- Insert into dept(first_name,dept_id,sex)values('ajit',3,'M');
